# Chat App
A full stack, real-time messaging application made with Angular, Angular Material, and Firebase
# About
Chat App was a group project made during Mizzou's hack week. The Original repository was made in a GitHub classroom that was private and also unforkable. The project was transferred to a public repository to be further updated by myself and allow for users to view the source code. Due to this transition, the project's commit history and branches were all lost.
# Installation
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.

## Local Development
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular Material
`ng add @angular/material`

## Google Firebase
`npm install firebase @angular/fire`
